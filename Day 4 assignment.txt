1) Write a Python program to count the elements in a list until an element is a tuple.
mylist=[1,2,3,(4,5)]
c=0
for i in mylist:
    if type(i)==tuple:
        break
    else:
        c+=1
print(c)

2)#create a tuple to store 5 numbers and then sort it in ascending and descending order.

mt=(3,6,8,9,1)
print(sorted(mt))
print(sorted(mt,reverse=True))

3)Write a Python program to find the repeated items of a tuple.

mt=(4,3,2,4,2,4)
print(max(mt))
repeated=0
for i in range(len(mt)):
    if mt.count(mt[i]>1):
        print("Repeated",mt[i])

part 2:set
1)accept 10 values from user and add them inside the set. now accept one more value from user
 and if it is present in the set, remove it. Make sure program doesn't give any error if number
  is not there inside the set.
myset=set({})
for i in range(1,11):
    value=int(input("Enter a value "))
    myset.add(value)
print(myset)
value1=int(input("Enter another value"))
if(value1 in myset) :
    myset.discard(value1)
print(myset)

part 3: Dictionary

1) accept 5 students name and store them in the dictionary by providing keys from 1 to 5 respectively.

name1=input("Enter a name")
name2=input("Enter a name")
name3=input("Enter a name")
name4=input("Enter a name")
name5=input("Enter a name")

dict={1:name1,2:name2,3:name3,4:name4,5:name5}
print(dict)

2)create a dictionary with pairs
	soap:100
	deo:300
	perfume:400

now accept a product name from user (in any case, so you have to handle "ignore case") and display its price. Also , if the product is not present in the dictionary display the error message " product not available "
Note:  you should not get "KeyError:" in the program.
dict={"soap":100,"deo":300,"perfume":400}
print(dict)
product=input("enter a product")
if(product=="soap"):
    print(dict["soap"])
elif(product=="deo"):
    print( print(dict["deo"]))

elif(product=="perfume"):
    print( print(dict["perfume"]))
else:
    print("product not available")

3)'''
1) accept 10 values from user and add them inside the set. now accept one more value from user
 and if it is present in the set, remove it. Make sure program doesn't give any error if number
  is not there inside the set.
'''
'''
3) define a class "Student" with members
	name,age,address and qualification
	
   define parameterized constructor and "str" member function which returns all the members

   create 4 objects of Student by passing values.

now create a dictionary with rollno ( start from 1 ) as a key and student object as a value.

accept a rollno from user and display all its details i.e. name,age,address and qualification.
also display message "student not found" in case if rollno entered by user is not available 
as a key inside the dictionary.
